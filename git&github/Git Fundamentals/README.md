# Git Fundamentals

## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that plays a central role in modern software development. In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of Git, from basic commands to branching and merging strategies.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of changes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Git and GitHub Relationship

Understand the relationship between Git and GitHub. Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features.

### 2. Repositories

A repository, or repo, is a container for a project. It includes the project's files and the revision history. Learn how to create a repository and manage its settings.

### 3. Branches

Branches allow for parallel development and experimentation without affecting the main project. Explore how branches work and how they can be used effectively.

### 4. Commits

Commits are snapshots of the project at a specific point in time. Learn how to make meaningful commits, add commit messages, and understand their role in tracking changes.

### 5. Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are proposals for changes, additions, or fixes to a repository. They initiate code review and facilitate collaboration. Understand the PR workflow.
