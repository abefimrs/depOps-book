## The Importance of Git in DevOps

### - Developers used to submit their codes to the central server without having copies of their own
### - Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
### - There was no communication between any of the developers


## Version Control

### Git helps track and manage code changes.
### Ensures the right versions are deployed.


## Collaboration

### Git enables seamless collaboration among team members.
### Supports concurrent work on code and infrastructure.


## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Git versioning for infrastructure configuration files.
### Ensures consistency and easier maintenance.


## CI/CD Integration

### Automated builds and deployments triggered by Git commits.
### Git hooks and webhooks initiate CI/CD processes.

## Slide 6: Branching Strategies


### Git branching for different deployment environments.
### Controlled flow of changes from development to production.


## Auditability

### Git's detailed change history and attribution.
### Essential for tracking issues and system evolution.
